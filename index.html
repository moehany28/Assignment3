   <h1>Lyrics to Umbrella</h1>
    <p>Uh-huh, uh-huh (Yeah, Rihanna)<br>
     Uh-huh, uh-huh (Good Girl Gone Bad)<br>
     Uh-huh, uh-huh (Take three, action)<br>
     Uh-huh, uh-huh (Hov)<br>
     [Verse 1: JAY-Z]<br>
     No clouds in my stones<br>
     Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank<br>
     Coming down with the Dow Jones<br>
     When the clouds come, we gone, we Roc-A-Fella<br>
     We fly higher than weather, in G5's or better<br>
     You know me (You know me)<br>
     In anticipation for precipitation, stack chips for the rainy day<br>
     Jay—Rain Man is back<br>
     With Little Miss Sunshine, Rihanna, where you at?<br>
     [Verse 2: Rihanna]<br>
     You have my heart<br>
     And we'll never be worlds apart<br>
     Maybe in magazines<br>
     But you'll still be my star<br>
     Baby, ‘cause in the dark<br>
     You can't see shiny cars<br>
     And that's when you need me there<br>
     With you, I'll always share<br>
     Because<br>
     [Chorus: Rihanna]<br>
     When the sun shine, we shine together<br>
     Told you I'll be here forever<br>
     Said I'll always be your friend<br>
     Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end<br>
     Now that it's raining more than ever<br>
     Know that we'll still have each other<br>
     You can stand under my umbrella<br>
     You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh<br>
     Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh<br>
     Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh<br>
     Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh<br>
     [Verse 3: Rihanna]<br>
     These fancy things<br>
     Will never come in between<br>
     You're part of my entity<br>
     Here for infinity<br>
     When the war has took its part<br>
     When the world has dealt its cards<br>
     If the hand is hard<br>
     Together we'll mend your heart<br>
     Because<br>
     [Chorus: Rihanna]<br>
     When the sun shine, we shine together<br>
     Told you I'll be here forever<br>
     Said I'll always be your friend<br>
     Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end<br>
     Now that it's raining more than ever<br>
     Know that we'll still have each other<br>
     You can stand under my umbrella<br>
     You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh<br>
     Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh<br>
     Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh<br>
     Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh<br>
     [Bridge: Rihanna]<br>
     You can run into my arms<br>
     It's okay, don't be alarmed<br>
     Come into me<br>
     There's no distance in between our love<br>
     So gon' and let the rain pour<br>
     I'll be all you need and more<br>
     Because<br>
     [Chorus: Rihanna]<br>
     When the sun shine, we shine together<br>
     Told you I'll be here forever<br>
     Said I'll always be your friend<br>
     Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end<br>
     Now that it's raining more than ever<br>
     Know that we'll still have each other<br>
     You can stand under my umbrella<br>
     You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh<br>
     Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh<br>
     Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh<br>
     Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh<br>
     [Outro: Rihanna]<br>
     It's rainin', rainin'<br>
     Ooh, baby, it's rainin', rainin'<br>
     Baby, come here to me<br>
     Come into me<br>
     It's rainin', rainin'<br>
     Ooh, baby, it's rainin', rainin'<br>
     You can always come into me<br>
     Come into me<br>
     It's pourin' rain<br>
     It's pourin' rain<br>
     Come here to me<br>
     Come into me<br>
     It's pourin' rain<br>
     It's pourin' rain <br>
